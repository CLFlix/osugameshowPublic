# osu! Gameshow

<strong>Hosted by <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18755966">\_Kurookami\_</a></strong>

## Rounds

### Guess The Background

In this round, players will try to guess what beatmap a background comes from, based on seeing only a small part of the background. Asking for a hint will make a bigger part of the beatmap available.

### Guess The Beatmap

Based on the composition of the map only, the participants will have to guess what beatmap is shown to them. A hint will reveal a fact about the map or something related to the map.

### Guess The Song

From a very short audio clip, the participants need to give me the title of the song that is being played. If they need to, they can use one of their hints to reveal a longer audio clip.

### Anagrams

Inspired by BTMC's mapper anagrams, this round will have the players guess what artist name is hidden in the scrambled bunch of letters.

### Trivia

Every traditional gameshow must have some shape or form of trivia. The last round is exactly that.

## Points

Every correctly answered question will hand out 50 points. Logically, the person with the most points at the end of the gameshow, wins.

## Prizepool

The top 3 players will receive prizes, the two others will walk away with empty hands. Despite these prizes laying on the table, I'd like for everyone to have a fun time and enjoy participating in this first edition of the osu! gameshow, hosted by me, \_Kurookami\_. Let's hope everything goes to plan without any major issues and maybe this will return for a next edition!
